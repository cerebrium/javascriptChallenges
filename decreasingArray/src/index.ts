/*
  Prompt: establish if you can make one change to an array to make it be increasing the entire time

  Thoughts:
    1. cannot change the order of the array
    2. will require at least linear time, since every element needs to be touched

  Plan:
    1. Keep a pointer to element behind and a count of amount of elements that are in decreasing order. 
      a. if the count is greater than one return false
